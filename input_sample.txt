Good morning, everyone. Let's get started with our weekly team sync. First on the agenda is the website redesign project. Sarah, can you give us a quick update?

Sure. We finalized the wireframes and started development on the homepage. The dev team is on track to complete the first phase by Friday. We had a minor issue with the image carousel, but that’s been resolved.

Great. Next up, the Q3 marketing strategy. James?

Yes, we’ve launched the initial social media campaigns and early engagement looks promising. We’re seeing higher click-through rates compared to last quarter. The blog content calendar is also finalized.

Excellent. Lastly, budget tracking. Priya?

We’re slightly over budget on the design tools, but under in other areas, so overall we’re balanced. I’ll send out a detailed breakdown later today.

Thanks, everyone. Let’s regroup next Monday with updates on progress and blockers.
